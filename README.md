## OmniSounds
I wanted to have different variations of custom note cut sounds for myself, just to notice that SoundReplacer didn't support this at all despite the fact the game itself does. So I made OmniSounds!
While SoundReplacer only supports using one sound for an entire category (i.e. custom cut sounds only ever have one noise, custom miss sounds only ever have one noise, so on and so forth), OmniSounds supports using *as many sounds as you like* for your note cut or miss sounds!

Do note that OmniSounds focuses exclusively on the note cut sounds, it currently does not implement custom menu music, button clicks, or song completion jingles.

OmniSounds is loosely based upon SoundReplacer's patches, but it is largely written from scratch.

### Usage
OmniSounds is only tested on **Beat Saber 1.39.1**. It will likely work on other versions but I can't promise anything.
When starting the game with OmniSounds for the first time, a ``OmniSounds`` folder will appear, with two subfolders ``BadSliceSounds`` and ``SliceSounds``.

Put as many files as you want in either of these folders in the following formats: ``".mp3", ".ogg", ".wav", ".flac", ".aiff", ".aif", ".mod", ".it", ".s3m", ".xm"``

The game will randomly pick one of the files to play as your cut sound.
